Here’s how to run and work with this `pimbot_cli.py` code in VS Code:

**Step 1 – Open the project in VS Code**
1. Launch VS Code.
2. Click **File → Open Folder**.
3. Select the folder containing `pimbot_cli.py`.

**Step 2 – Save and verify Python is installed**
1. Make sure your code is saved as `pimbot_cli.py`.
2. In VS Code, open the integrated terminal (**View → Terminal**).
3. Type:
   ```bash
   python --version
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   py --version
   ```
   to verify Python is installed.

**Step 3 – Run the program**
1. In the terminal, run:
   ```bash
   python pimbot_cli.py
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   py pimbot_cli.py
   ```
2. A Tkinter window should appear with your PIMBot assessment UI.

**Step 4 – (Optional) Set up a Run Configuration**
1. In VS Code, click the **Run and Debug** icon (left toolbar).
2. Click **Create a launch.json file** → choose **Python File**.
3. This allows you to start the program anytime with the green “Run” button.

Do you want me to also give you the **steps to package this into a .exe** from within VS Code so you can run it without opening VS Code or Python?
